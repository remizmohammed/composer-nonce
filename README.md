# composer-nonce
This is a Custom Composer package which mirror the functionality of wordpress core wp_nonce_* methods.

To use this package in your composer project,

type below command at root directory,

```
composer require remizmohammed/composer-nonce "@dev"
```
Please note: Since this package uses wordpress functions,it works in composer wordpress installations only. We are updating this package to work in isolations.
